# twitter-spider

Given this page:
https://twitter.com/xyz

Write, in plain ruby, a spider to download the page and extract the following information about each tweet:

image url of author of tweet
author name
author username
body of tweet
image url included with tweet
timestamp of tweet

Export that information from the page as a JSON package (Array of Hashes).

When your script runs, it should just read the given twitter timeline and spit out the JSON.
